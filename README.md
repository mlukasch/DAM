# DAM
OBEU Data Analysis and Mining repository

# Aim

This repository hosts implementation of the OBEU Data Analysis and Mining (The ten tasks defined in D2.3).
Currently, it has three branches: master, staging, and production.
OBEU Partners are encouraged to creat their own branches for doing testing (Python, Java, etc.), better just use their personal name as the branch name.
